# foldx_uncertainty

## Overview

This repo contains the code and datasets used in the manuscript, "Statistical Modeling to Quantify the Uncertainty of FoldX-Predicted Protein Folding and Binding Stability" by Sapozhnikov et al.

In order to run the code, git clone this repository and preserve the folder structure. All original datasets as well as intermediate outputs are already present in appropriate folders, and will be simply replaced if you re-run the codes. Some of the model search, especially the best subset selection, may take awhile.

In order to apply our model to your own data, run the file 07_application.Rmd.
